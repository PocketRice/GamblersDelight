// Pack all transition-related things into this class.
// The Transition object is basically a Timeline (find way to extend?).
// Instead of having to manually set "rate(1), rate(-1), play, etc." handle all that here.
// Perhaps auto-deduce whether to use color or numeric transition based on the property.
// Use CSSManager's validateCss() to ensure css is correct (and avoid a debugging nightmare).
